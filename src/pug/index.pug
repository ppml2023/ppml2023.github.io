                            | The primary purpose of the workshop is to strengthen collaborations between the communities of machine learning and security and privacy. The workshop will bring together experts from both areas to discuss and exchange ideas on privacy-preserving techniques for training, inference, and disclosure. The event consists of invited talks and contributed papers focused on privacy-aware data analysis. We believe that the workshop will provide an opportunity for researchers to come up with innovative solutions to the challenges of privacy-aware machine learning and facilitate cross-domain collaboration between researchers.
