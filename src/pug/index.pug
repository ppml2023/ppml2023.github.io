                            | The primary purpose of the workshop is to strengthen collaborations between the communities of machine learning and security and privacy. The workshop will bring together experts from both areas to discuss and exchange ideas on privacy-preserving techniques for training, inference, and disclosure. The event consists of invited talks and contributed papers focused on privacy-aware data analysis. We believe that the workshop will provide an opportunity for researchers to come up with innovative solutions to the challenges of privacy-aware machine learning and facilitate cross-domain collaboration between researchers.

                            strong Abstract:
                            | Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed collaborative learning paradigm by decoupling the learning task from the centralized server to a decentralized population of edge clients. An attractive feature of federated learning is its default client privacy, allowing clients to jointly learn a global model while keeping their sensitive training data locally and only share local model updates with the federated server(s). However, FL may not guarantee responsible distributed learning. First, clients are heterogeneous with diverse computing resources, which may prevent thin clients with less resources to participate in federated learning. Second, recent studies have revealed that the default privacy in FL is insufficient for protecting the confidentiality of clientsâ€™ training data and the safety of the global model. Finally, federated learning is vulnerable to trojan attacks, which may poison both data and the local model updates. This keynote will describe model leakage risks and model poisoning risks in distributed collaborative learning systems, ranging from image understanding, video analytics, to large language models (LLMs), and provide insights for risk mitigation methods and techniques, ensuring responsible Federated Learning.
